# Kimberly L. Torres

I am a Software Development major at Brigham Young University-Idaho and am passionate about solving problems and learning new technologies. My studies have given me a solid foundation in coding, software development, web development, and how to use technology to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on projects like building websites or exploring how to use data to make decisions. I am a team player who likes collaborating and looking for ways to grow and improve my skills.

## About Me
- I am currently learning many aspects of software development including frontend and backend programming.
- I aim to build a long-term career in programming with a company where I can contribute to its growth and success for many years.
- My focus is on continuously improving my skills and providing value through innovative solutions.

## Technologies and Tools
- Proficient in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Python, C#, .net, and SQL

## Favorite Project
- My favorite project so far would be the Inventory Management program that I built for a local pharmacy. It helps them keep an accurate account of their controlled inventory. It uses a secure database to store all the information on each medication. It allows them to add and manage drugs and get specific reports. This way, they will always know exactly how much medication they have at any given moment. It utilizes an API from their pharmacy software that automatically updates the numbers as they use medications.
